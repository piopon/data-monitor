This single page application is used to display the data provided by the [scraper backend service](https://github.com/piopon/web-scraper) in a minimalist form factor.
When needed it can also be configured to use the predefined notifiers and send a message when the received data values meet the defined criterias. For example: when the received data represent a price value then we can send a notification message when this price is lower than a specific threshold.
